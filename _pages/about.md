# Hello! 

Iâ€™m Chao Zhao (èµµè¶…), a Ph.D. candidate at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where I am fortunate to be working under the guidance of Prof. Weiming Shen. I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Politecnico Milano (Polimi) under the supervision of Enrico Zio.

My academic interests revolve around XXXX. Lately, my research has been centered on the application of foundational models like vision-language models in anomaly detection tasks, alongside my exploration of Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection.

Beyond visual anomaly detection, my long-term goal is to empower intelligent visual systems with reasoning and planning capabilities about anomalies. This approach aims to enable these systems to handle and recover from potential open-world anomalies, thereby achieving better robustness and safety for fields such as intelligent manufacturing and autonomous driving.

If you find my research intriguing, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch with me. I welcome any inquiries or discussions regarding my work! ðŸ˜Š

Recently, I have been looking for postdoctoral openings. If you have any opportunities or are interested in collaborating, please feel free to email me!
